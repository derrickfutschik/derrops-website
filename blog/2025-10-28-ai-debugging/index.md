Difference between Learning and Doing is always a merky thing. You don’t really know if you can do something yet until you try. Even if you have learnt all the material, we need that self-validation and confidence to develop our skills.

AI confronts developers with a new reality though. I used to work part-time at an Advanced Manufacturing company. My first role was to find and fix bugs. Later I would come to understand these were regressions. The machine used to make a tool a certain way given said instructions, now it does something else.

The codebase was immensely complex. It was written by a bunch of genius Russian Mathematicians, there was no way I could understand this code base with the abilities I had at the time. Bits a pieces sure, but to be honest, compared to what I’m able to comprehend these days well over 10 years, the difference is stark.

When I first tried to do this, I used debugging manually in eclipse and Visual Studio C++ (not VS Code), not really knowing where to look.

This was uterrly futile,

Work

Everything
Replacement for SO only
Even using stack overflow was frowned upon instead of reading API docs
You do need to learn how to read API docs
Ask it about the code base
1-2 years

You can use AI to debug, generate code, help draft stories, explain code bae
Generate documentation
Generate diagrams
Read, query
2-4 years

4+ years => Let’s face it, everything

Own Time
In your own time you can use it for everything, but is still good to learn new things, and experiment, as this not something you can do normally otherwise.
