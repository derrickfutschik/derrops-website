When I look at my long relationship with stackoverlow, I realise that is a resentful one.

It was disrimenentor society:
Those who had the rep, and those who didn’t

You’re thinking of “Nosedive”, the first episode of Season 3 of Black Mirror (released in 2016).

Here’s a quick summary:

🧠 Premise

In a pastel-colored, near-future society, every social interaction is rated on a 1-to-5 star scale through a universal mobile-based reputation system.
A person’s average rating determines their social status, access to housing, travel, and even employment opportunities — a literal social-credit score.

👩 Main character

Lacie Pound (played by Bryce Dallas Howard) is obsessed with improving her 4.2 rating so she can qualify for a luxury apartment. She tries to climb the social ladder by networking with highly rated acquaintances and performing a constant act of cheerful perfection.

⚠️ Plot arc

Lacie’s plan to boost her rating collapses after a series of small public mishaps.

Each social encounter spirals downward as people down-vote her.

Her rating plummets, cutting her off from flights, car rentals, and basic services.

The episode ends with her stripped of all social access — but finally able to speak honestly for the first time.

💬 Themes

Superficiality of online validation and influencer culture

Class stratification through algorithmic scoring

Psychological pressure of constant self-censorship

Parallels to real-world “social credit” systems and social-media clout

Would you like me to include how that episode connects to real-world social-credit initiatives (e.g., China’s pilot programs or Western equivalents like Uber/Airbnb ratings)?
