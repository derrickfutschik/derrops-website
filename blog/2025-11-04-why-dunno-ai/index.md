Suprise suprise, best design RAG was to do what people were doing 100s of years ago in the library.

Going to the section of books on the topic of interest
Looking for books on the topic
Reading the description of the book
Looking at the table of contents for the section(s) of interest
Then reading those sections.

It wasn't to ingest the entire book into some crazy vector algorithm, with wild matrix math, and doing crazy things.

Look I'm kidding but not kidding at the same time. Now it does look like that is an amazing way of doing RAG.
But what's weird to me is it took quite a journey to get to this point, but isn't that strange?
Millions of people looking into this area. The name AI - Artificial Intelligence, even kind of contains the answer. To replicate human intelligence, i.e. do what humans do.
So why did we not just look up information in the way which we do already in deep topics? I find this super interesting in human behaviour.

Even Agentic AI, with agents all working together as a team, with experts in each domain... sounds familiar again? Albeit this did happen fast, but also not really at the same time, I mean we know we were doing this. So why did we not do this sooner? Albeit this one is a bit more interesting in the sense that a higher abstraction of intelligence may encapsulate entire teams in the future, and this serves only as a humanistic representation that we are able to comprehend, rather than difference sections of a neural network firing, which is ultimately completely abstract, and incompressibly complex in the shear number of parameters. 

Now back to RAG. I'm not saying this method is the best, there is no definitive solution here, all approaches have trade-offs, but it is interesting this method does look superior to chunking, which had been the way at least for some time.
But it makes you think. There are problems in AI being worked on right now, where we need only replicate what we are doing already. Perhaps these ideas are not noval enough to drive AI research, I'd love to know what people think about this?

I'm an engineer. To me, that means I am able to use knowledge I don't fully understand, and solve problems. Hell I can fix bugs without understanding the code. Some people don't want to admit that. But I honestly take pride in the fact I am able to do things with tools to exceed my own intelligence. It goes back to that image of the most efficient mamal at long distance travel. The human actually doesn't rank so far off. But a human with a bike is by far the best.

That's how I view being an engineer. I got on a bicyle, and have no shame in that at all. If my job was to understand and comprehend everything that wouldn't be engineering. It's not that I am a bad engineer. It's just not what engineering is. I can find bugs by observing changes in codebase Vs output. I can use libraries and tools to solve problems. I can find patterns and solve one thing because it looks like something I've seen before. I can verify solutions because that is the nature of those solutions, I don't need to achedemically comprehend them.
